# SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector for on-Road Object detection

This is [SSD](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) variation for on-road object detection such as KITTI, CITYSCAPES dataset  

Our main points of variation from SSD are  

1. We designed feature extractor networks(or base networks) ***Wide-Residual-Inception-Networks*** which is higher accuracy and faster than reduced-VGG16 or ResNet-101.  
2. we proposed ***Restricted Random Sampling*** instead of Random Sampling.

When we finish writing our paper, we'll upload details.
